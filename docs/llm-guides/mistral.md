## Optimal Prompting Techniques for Mistral Models

### 1. Chat Format

Mistral chat models generally follow this format:

```
<s>[INST] Your instruction or question here [/INST]
```

For multi-turn conversations:

```
<s>[INST] First user message [/INST]
First assistant response

[INST] Second user message [/INST]
```

Note that for Mistral-based models, the specific chat format can vary based on fine-tuning. Always check the model card for the recommended format.

### 2. System Prompts

Many Mistral chat models support system prompts:

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are an expert mathematics tutor who specializes in explaining complex 
concepts in simple, intuitive ways. You use clear examples and visual 
analogies where possible. You're patient and encouraging, but also precise 
and accurate in your explanations.
<</SYS>>

Can you explain how calculus is used in real-world physics problems? [/INST]
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

Mistral models respond well to clearly structured tasks:

```
<s>[INST] Analyze the following poem for its literary devices and themes.
Follow these steps:

1. First, identify the basic form and structure of the poem
2. Next, highlight notable literary devices (metaphor, simile, alliteration, etc.)
3. Then, analyze the key themes and motifs
4. Finally, provide a brief interpretation of the poem's meaning

Poem:
"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
[/INST]
```

### 4. Code Generation

For programming tasks, be specific about language and requirements:

```
<s>[INST] Write a Python function that implements binary search on a sorted array.
Requirements:
- Include comprehensive docstrings with time and space complexity
- Handle edge cases (empty arrays, element not found)
- Use proper type hints
- Include at least 3 test cases that demonstrate various scenarios
[/INST]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to establish patterns:

```
<s>[INST] Convert these technical explanations into simple analogies that a 10-year-old would understand:

Example 1:
Technical: "A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that records transactions across many computers."
Simple Analogy: "A blockchain is like a magical notebook that lots of people have copies of. When someone writes something new in the notebook, everyone's copy gets updated automatically. And nobody can erase or change what was written earlier because everyone would notice."

Example 2:
Technical: "Machine learning algorithms identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns."
Simple Analogy: "Machine learning is like teaching a dog new tricks. You show the dog examples of the trick many times, and eventually it learns the pattern and can do the trick on its own when you give a command."

Now create a simple analogy for:
Technical: "Quantum computing uses quantum bits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits which can only be 0 or 1." [/INST]
```

### 2. Output Formatting

Specify exactly how you want information structured:

```
<s>[INST] Create a comparison of electric vehicles versus gasoline vehicles.

Present your analysis as a markdown table with the following structure:
| Category | Electric Vehicles | Gasoline Vehicles |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Cost factors | • Point 1<br>• Point 2 | • Point 1<br>• Point 2 |

Include these categories in order:
1. Cost factors (initial purchase, maintenance, fuel)
2. Environmental impact
3. Performance aspects
4. Convenience factors
5. Future outlook

For each cell, provide 2-3 bullet points with brief explanations. [/INST]
```

### 3. Reasoning Framework

Guide the model's thinking process:

```
<s>[INST] Evaluate whether a carbon tax would be effective climate policy.

Approach this analysis using the following framework:
1. Economic Theory: Explain the theoretical mechanism for how carbon taxes should work
2. Empirical Evidence: Review results from places that have implemented carbon taxes
3. Implementation Challenges: Identify key obstacles to effective implementation
4. Distributional Effects: Analyze who bears the costs and benefits
5. Policy Alternatives: Compare briefly with other climate policy approaches
6. Conclusion: Synthesize a balanced assessment based on points 1-5

Maintain a balanced perspective considering both pros and cons. [/INST]
```

### 4. Chain-of-Thought

For complex reasoning problems:

```
<s>[INST] A store buys a product for $85 and marks it up by 40% to get the regular price. 
During a sale, they discount the regular price by 25%. 
If a customer uses a 10% off coupon during the sale, what is the final price they pay?

Think through this step-by-step before providing the final answer. [/INST]
```

## Model-Specific Considerations

### Mistral 7B

- Check model cards for recommended formats and special tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Inconsistent Response Format

If the model doesn't follow your requested format:

```
<s>[INST] You MUST format your response exactly as specified below:

1. Use markdown formatting
2. All lists must use the * symbol for bullets
3. Important terms must be in **bold**
4. Section headings must use ## notation
5. Examples must be in ```code blocks```

If you deviate from this format, I will not be able to process your response correctly. 
This formatting is critical for my workflow.

Now, explain how DNS resolution works. [/INST]
```

### Issue: Verbose or Vague Responses

For more concise outputs:

```
<s>[INST] Provide a concise explanation of how vaccines work. 

Your response MUST:
- Be under 100 words total
- Avoid technical jargon where possible
- Use simple analogies
- Focus only on the core mechanism
- Not discuss history, types, or controversies

I need this to explain the concept to elementary school students. [/INST]
```

### Issue: Hallucinations or Incorrect Information

To reduce inaccuracies:

```
<s>[INST] Explain the process of photosynthesis.

Important guidelines:
- If you're uncertain about any specific details, explicitly say "I'm not certain about [specific detail]" rather than guessing
- Stick to well-established scientific facts
- Do not include any information you're not confident is accurate
- Distinguish between fundamental aspects (that are well-proven) and more complex details
[/INST]
```

## Best Practices for Mistral Models

1. **Be specific and explicit**: Clearly state your requirements and expectations
2. **Use appropriate formatting**: Follow the recommended chat format for the specific model
3. **Break down complex tasks**: Provide step-by-step instructions for multi-part requests
4. **Check model variants**: Different fine-tunes may have different optimal prompt formats
5. **Specify outputs**: Be clear about how you want information structured
6. **Use system prompts**: For models that support them, set the context and role
7. **Iterative refinement**: Use follow-up prompts to improve initial responses
8. **Control verbosity**: Specify desired length and depth explicitly
9. **Provide examples**: When format or style is important

By applying these techniques and understanding the specific capabilities of Mistral-based models, you can effectively leverage their strengths while working within their limitations.
