# Role Prompting

## Overview

Role prompting is a technique that instructs the LLM to adopt a specific persona, professional role, or character when generating responses. By asking the model to "act as" or "think like" a particular type of expert or character, you can access specialized knowledge patterns, communication styles, and reasoning approaches that are associated with that role.

## Key Benefits
