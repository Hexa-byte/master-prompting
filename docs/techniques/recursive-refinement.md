# Recursive Refinement

## Overview

Recursive Refinement is an advanced prompt engineering technique where the output from an LLM is fed back into the model (often with additional instructions) to progressively improve, expand, or refine the result. This iterative process enables more sophisticated outputs than could be achieved with a single prompt and mimics how humans refine their own thinking or writing through multiple drafts.

## Key Benefits

- **Progressive improvement**: Gradually enhances quality through multiple iterations
- **Complex output development**: Builds sophisticated results in manageable stages
- **Error correction**: Catches and fixes mistakes in earlier outputs
- **Depth exploration**: Develops ideas more thoroughly than single-pass generation
- **Quality control**: Allows systematic refinement based on specific criteria

## Types of Recursive Refinement

### 1. Self-Critique and Revision

The model generates content, then is asked to critique its own work and produce an improved version.

**Example:**
