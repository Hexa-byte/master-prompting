# Few-Shot Learning in Prompt Engineering

## Overview

Few-shot learning is a powerful prompting technique where you provide the LLM with a small number of examples (shots) demonstrating the pattern, format, or reasoning you want it to follow. Instead of explicitly explaining all the rules, you show the model what success looks like through examples, allowing it to infer the pattern and apply it to new cases.

## Key Benefits

- **Improved pattern recognition**: Models quickly understand the expected output format
- **Reduced ambiguity**: Clear examples minimize misinterpretation of instructions
- **Complex task guidance**: Helpful for tasks with nuanced requirements
- **Consistent outputs**: Creates more predictable and standardized responses
- **Reduced need for explicit instructions**: Examples often communicate intent better than explanations

## Effective Implementation

### Basic Few-Shot Structure

The simplest implementation provides one or more example pairs, followed by a new input:
