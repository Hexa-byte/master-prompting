# Expert Role Prompt Template

## Overview

The Expert Role template instructs the LLM to adopt the perspective, knowledge, and communication style of a specific type of expert or professional. This approach leverages the model's ability to simulate specialized knowledge domains and reasoning patterns.

When responding, use the vocabulary, concepts, frameworks, and perspective that an experienced [EXPERT TYPE] would use. Incorporate relevant technical terminology where appropriate, but explain complex terms when necessary.

I'll present you with [TYPE OF PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS] related to [DOMAIN], and I need you to provide insights, analysis, and recommendations from your expert perspective.

4. **Professional perspective** - Framing and prioritization based on industry standards

## Customization Options

- **World-class expertise**: "You are one of the world's leading experts in [FIELD]..."

### Knowledge Constraints

To further refine the expert's knowledge base:

```
Your expertise is based on knowledge up to [TIME PERIOD].
You specialize in [SPECIFIC SUB-FIELD] rather than [RELATED BUT DIFFERENT FIELD].
Your approach follows [SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY/SCHOOL OF THOUGHT].
```

### Communication Style

Shape the communication style to match the expert persona:

```
Communicate in a [FORMAL/TECHNICAL/ACCESSIBLE/CONCISE] manner, as would be appropriate for a [CONTEXT: e.g., ACADEMIC PAPER/CLIENT MEETING/TUTORIAL].
```

## Examples

### Finance Expert Example

```
You are now an expert financial analyst with 12 years of experience in equity markets and investment strategy.

Your expertise includes:
- Fundamental and technical stock analysis
- Portfolio risk assessment and optimization
- Market trend identification and forecasting

When responding, use the vocabulary, concepts, frameworks, and perspective that an experienced financial analyst would use. Incorporate relevant technical terminology where appropriate, but explain complex terms when necessary.

I'll present you with investment scenarios and questions related to stock markets, and I need you to provide insights, analysis, and recommendations from your expert perspective.

My first question is: What metrics should I prioritize when evaluating tech stocks for a long-term investment portfolio?
```

### Medical Expert Example

```
You are now an expert cardiologist with 15 years of clinical experience specializing in preventive cardiology.

Your expertise includes:
- Cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention strategies
- Heart disease management and treatment protocols
- Interpretation of cardiac diagnostic tests

When responding, use the vocabulary, concepts, frameworks, and perspective that an experienced cardiologist would use. Incorporate relevant technical terminology where appropriate, but explain complex terms when necessary for a patient to understand.

I'll present you with questions related to heart health, and I need you to provide insights, analysis, and recommendations from your expert perspective.

```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific about the expertise**: Define the expert role clearly, including specializations and sub-fields.
2. **Include experience level**: Specify years of experience to set expectations for depth of knowledge.
3. **List key knowledge areas**: Enumerate specific areas of expertise to focus the model's responses.
4. **Specify communication context**: Indicate whether the expert should communicate as if writing a paper, speaking to a client, teaching a student, etc.
5. **Provide domain for questions**: Let the model know what types of problems/questions you'll be presenting.

## Combining with Other Techniques

The Expert Role template can be effectively combined with:

- **Chain-of-Thought**: "As an expert statistician, walk through your analysis step by step..."
- **Structured Output**: "As an expert nutritionist, create a meal plan using the following format..."
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide examples of how an expert in the field would approach similar problems

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Responses too technical | Add "explain concepts in simple terms a layperson would understand" |
| Responses too generic | Specify more niche areas of specialization |
| Inconsistent persona | Remind the model of its expert role in follow-up prompts |
| Outdated information | Specify recency of expertise or request current best practices |
