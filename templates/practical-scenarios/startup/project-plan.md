Please create a comprehensive project plan that includes:

   - Key tasks within each phase
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Estimated effort for each task

3. Timeline and Milestones
   - Gantt chart or sequential timeline
   - Critical path identification
   - Key milestones and decision points
   - Buffer allocation recommendations

4. Resource Allocation
   - Team responsibilities

   - External resource needs
   - Budget allocation by project phase

5. Risk Management
   - Potential risks assessment
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Contingency planning

```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
- Provides comprehensive context about your project needs and constraints
- Breaks down the plan into all critical components of project management
- Encourages practical recommendations tied to your specific situation
- Addresses risk management and communication, often overlooked elements
- Creates a roadmap with clear next steps and priority actions

## Variations

### For Digital Product Development
Add this section to the prompt:
```
This is a digital product development project involving design, development, and launch phases. Please include specific sections on user testing, quality assurance, technical requirements definition, and product release processes. Recommend appropriate sprint structures if using an Agile approach.
```

### For Event or Launch Planning
Add this section to the prompt:
```
This project culminates in a specific event/launch on [DATE]. Please organize the plan with a reverse timeline working backward from the launch date, highlighting critical preparation deadlines. Include detailed day-of execution planning and post-event follow-up activities.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. Be as specific as possible about your project goals and constraints
2. Provide realistic timeframes and resource availability
3. Be transparent about potential obstacles and dependencies
4. After receiving the plan, identify the most critical milestones to monitor
5. Consider this a living document - review and adjust regularly as the project progresses
