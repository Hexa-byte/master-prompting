# Prospective Client Outreach Message Prompt

## Use Case
Crafting a personalized, effective outreach message to a potential client that generates interest without being pushy.

## Prompt Template

```
I need to create a personalized outreach message to a potential client. Please help me craft an effective, non-pushy message based on the following information:

About the prospect:
- Company name: [COMPANY NAME]
- Industry: [INDUSTRY]
- Contact person: [NAME]
- Position: [TITLE]
- Recent company news or achievement: [OPTIONAL - ANY RECENT COMPANY DEVELOPMENT]
- Connection point (if any): [OPTIONAL - HOW YOU KNOW THEM OR MUTUAL CONNECTION]

About my product/service:
- What I'm offering: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- Primary value proposition: [MAIN BENEFIT TO CLIENT]
- Specific problem I solve for similar clients: [PAIN POINT ADDRESSED]
- Proof point: [BRIEF SUCCESS STORY OR METRIC FROM SIMILAR CLIENT]

My goal for this message:
[SPECIFIC DESIRED OUTCOME, E.G., "SCHEDULE A DEMO CALL," "GET A RESPONSE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR NEEDS"]

Please create a personalized outreach message that:
1. Opens with a relevant, specific connection point or observation about their company
2. Briefly introduces myself and my company
3. Explains why I'm reaching out specifically to them
4. Mentions how I've helped similar companies without making exaggerated claims
5. Includes a clear, low-pressure call to action
6. Maintains a professional but conversational tone
7. Is concise (150-200 words maximum)

Format it for the appropriate channel: [EMAIL/LINKEDIN/OTHER]
```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
- Includes specific details about the prospect to enable true personalization
- Focuses on value and solving problems rather than just product features
- Establishes credibility through relevant proof points
- Creates a message that respects the prospect's time with brevity and clarity
- Emphasizes a conversational, non-pushy approach that's more likely to get a response

## Variations

### For Cold Outreach (No Connection)
Modify this part of the prompt:
```
I have no direct connection to this prospect. Please focus on their recent company news or industry challenge as an opening rather than claiming a connection. Make sure the message clearly explains why I'm reaching out to them specifically rather than feeling like a mass email.
```

### For Follow-up After No Response
Add this to the prompt:
```
This is a follow-up message after my initial outreach received no response. Please create a brief, valuable message that provides an additional insight or resource related to their challenge, without sounding frustrated or pushy about the lack of response.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. Always research the prospect before outreach - personalization based on real insights is key
2. Include a genuine, specific observation about their business when possible
3. Keep the focus on their challenges rather than your solution in the initial outreach
4. Make your call-to-action clear but low-pressure (asking for a 15-minute call is better than asking for a sale)
5. Test different approaches and track which messages get the best response rates
