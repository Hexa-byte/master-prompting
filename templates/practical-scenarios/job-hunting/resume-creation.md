# Resume Creation Prompt

## Use Case
Creating a tailored resume that highlights relevant experience and skills for a specific job application.

## Prompt Template

```
I need help creating a professional resume for a [JOB TITLE] position. 

About me:
- Experience: [BRIEFLY LIST YOUR RELEVANT WORK HISTORY, E.G., "5 YEARS IN MARKETING, 2 YEARS IN TEAM MANAGEMENT"]
- Education: [LIST DEGREES, CERTIFICATIONS, OR RELEVANT TRAINING]
- Key skills: [LIST 3-5 OF YOUR STRONGEST RELEVANT SKILLS]
- Achievements: [LIST 1-3 SIGNIFICANT PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS]

The job description emphasizes these requirements:
[PASTE 3-5 KEY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE JOB POSTING]

Please create a concise, one-page resume that:
1. Includes a brief professional summary highlighting my fit for this role
2. Presents my experience in reverse chronological order with bullet points focusing on achievements rather than just responsibilities
3. Highlights skills and qualifications that directly match the job requirements
4. Uses action verbs and quantifies achievements where possible
5. Has a clean, professional format that would pass through Applicant Tracking Systems

Please use a modern but professional format suitable for my industry.
```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
- Provides your relevant background information in a structured format
- Includes specific elements from the job description to enable tailoring
- Sets clear expectations for length, structure, and formatting
- Asks for achievement-focused content, which is more impactful than just listing responsibilities
- Addresses practical concerns like ATS compatibility

## Variations

### For Career Changers
Add this section to the prompt:
```
I'm transitioning from [PREVIOUS FIELD] to [TARGET FIELD]. Please highlight my transferable skills and frame my experience to show relevance to this new role.
```

### For Recent Graduates
Add this section to the prompt:
```
As a recent graduate with limited professional experience, please emphasize my education, relevant coursework, academic achievements, internships, and any volunteer or extracurricular activities that demonstrate relevant skills.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. Be specific about your achievements with numbers when possible (e.g., "increased sales by 27%" rather than "increased sales")
2. Include the actual job title from the listing, not a generic version
3. Copy the exact language for key skills from the job description
4. For best results, paste in the most important requirements from the actual job listing
5. Review and customize the generated resume - AI suggestions should be a starting point, not the final product
