# Thank You Letter Prompt

## Use Case
Crafting a concise, effective thank you letter after a job interview that reinforces your candidacy.

## Prompt Template

```
I need to write a brief thank you email following a job interview. Please help me create a professional and genuine message based on the following details:

Position: [JOB TITLE]
Company: [COMPANY NAME]
Interview date: [DATE]
Interviewer name(s): [NAME(S)]

Key points from the interview:
- [MENTION 1-2 SPECIFIC TOPICS OR PROJECTS DISCUSSED]
- [NOTE ANY PARTICULAR CONNECTIONS MADE OR INTERESTS SHARED]

A skill or qualification I want to emphasize: [SKILL THAT MATCHES JOB REQUIREMENTS]

Something I forgot to mention or want to clarify: [OPTIONAL - ANYTHING YOU WISH YOU HAD SAID]

Please create a concise thank you email that:
1. Expresses genuine appreciation for the opportunity
2. References specific conversation points to personalize the message
3. Reinforces my enthusiasm and fit for the role
4. Includes a brief mention of next steps
5. Maintains a professional but warm tone
6. Is no longer than 3 short paragraphs

Format it as a complete email with subject line, greeting, body, and sign-off.
```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
- Provides all the essential context needed for a personalized message
- Reminds you to include specific details from the interview, making it clear this isn't a generic template
- Creates a natural opportunity to emphasize a key qualification or address anything missed
- Keeps the message appropriately brief and focused
- Includes a complete email structure so nothing is overlooked

## Variations

### For Panel Interviews
Modify this section of the prompt:
```
I interviewed with multiple people. Please create a single email addressed to the main interviewer ([PRIMARY INTERVIEWER NAME]), but briefly acknowledge the other team members I met with ([OTHER NAMES]), and make it appropriate to send to all of them if needed.
```

### For Follow-up After No Response
Add this to the prompt:
```
This is a follow-up thank you as I haven't heard back in [NUMBER] weeks. Please maintain an interested but not desperate tone, and include a polite inquiry about the timeline for the hiring decision.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. Send the thank you email within 24 hours of your interview
2. Mention something specific that was discussed to show you were engaged and attentive
3. Keep it concise - hiring managers appreciate brevity
4. Proofread carefully before sending - even a small typo can create a negative impression
5. If you interviewed with multiple people, send individual emails with unique content to each person if possible
