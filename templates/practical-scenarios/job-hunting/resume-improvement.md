# Resume Improvement Prompt

## Use Case
Analyzing a resume against a job description to identify improvement opportunities and make it more competitive.

## Prompt Template

```
I need help improving my resume for a [JOB TITLE] position. Please analyze my current resume against the job description and provide specific recommendations.

Job Description:
[PASTE THE FULL JOB DESCRIPTION HERE]

My Current Resume:
[PASTE YOUR CURRENT RESUME CONTENT HERE]

Please provide a detailed analysis that includes:

1. Resume-Job Match Assessment:
   - Score my resume's alignment with this role on a scale of 1-10
   - Identify key requirements from the job description that aren't adequately addressed
   - List any skills or experiences I have that could be better highlighted

2. Content Improvement Suggestions:
   - Recommend 3-5 specific bullet points I should add or revise
   - Suggest stronger action verbs or language to replace any weak phrasing
   - Identify any irrelevant content that could be removed

3. ATS Optimization:
   - List important keywords from the job description that should be incorporated
   - Suggest any formatting changes to improve ATS compatibility

4. Structure Recommendations:
   - Advise if any sections should be reordered or reformatted
   - Suggest any additional sections that might strengthen my application

Please be specific and provide examples where possible. Focus on tangible changes that will make my resume more competitive for this particular role.
```

## Why This Works

This prompt is effective because it:
- Provides both your current resume and the target job description for direct comparison
- Requests a structured analysis across multiple dimensions (content, keywords, format)
- Asks for specific, actionable recommendations rather than general advice
- Focuses on ATS optimization, which is crucial in today's hiring processes
- Encourages prioritization of the most important improvements

## Variations

### For Experienced Professionals with a Long Resume
Add this section to the prompt:
```
My resume is currently [NUMBER] pages long. Please also suggest which experiences or details could be condensed or removed to create a more focused, concise document while preserving my most relevant qualifications.
```

### For Career Changers
Add this section to the prompt:
```
I'm transitioning from [CURRENT/PREVIOUS FIELD] to [TARGET FIELD]. Please particularly focus on identifying transferable skills and experiences I could reframe to show relevance to this new role.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. Paste the entire job description, not just parts of it, to ensure all requirements are analyzed
2. Include your complete resume content in a clean text format
3. If you have a specific section you're concerned about, mention it explicitly
4. Consider running this analysis for each job application, as requirements vary
5. Implement the highest-priority suggestions first, especially keyword additions and bullet point improvements
